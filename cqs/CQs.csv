CQ id,CQ,Terms added,Comments
1,"What are the emissions of an activity (e.g., training a model)?","prov:Activity, eo:hasEmissionScore, eo:EmissionScore, qudt:value",We can also create EmissionGenerationActivity to specialize prov:Activity
2,Who is responsible for that activity?,"prov:Activity, prov:wasAssociatedWith, prov:Agent",
3,Can I retrieve all the emissions of the activities I was responsible for a specific year?,"eo:hasEmissionScore, eo:EmissionScore, prov:Activity, prov:wasAssociatedWith, prov:Agent, prov:generatedAtTime",
4,What Emission Conversion Factor was used to calculate the emissions of this activity?,"eo:EmissionConversionFactor, eo:hasEmissionScore, eo:EmissionScore, qudt:value, prov:wasDerivedFrom",
5,"What other compatible conversion factors (e.g., from previous years, different countries) can be used in this emission calculation for this activity?","eo:EmissionConversionFactor, eo:hasCategory, eo:hasSourceQuantity, eo:hasScope, eo:targetUnit","We need both the quantity kind and the category due to how the data is being modeled in the UK (l1, l2 and l3 categories)"
6,"What activities (e.g., refrigerated storage) does the emission calculation include?","eo:hasEmissionScore, eo:EmissionScore, eo:EmissionCalculationActivity, prov:Activity",Tou would have to query all the ECAs that have an emission Score
7,"Who was responsible for producing the emission calculations (if software/third party, on whose behalf)?",Similar to Q2,
8,What was the methodology used for this emission calculation?,??,We need examples
9,What inputs and in what quantities did the calculation process used those inputs to generate the emission score?,"prov:used, prov:wasGeneratedBy, eo:EmissionCalculationActivity, eo:EmissionCalculationEntity, qudt:value, qudt:unit",
10,"What entity (e.g, refrigerator, herd of animals), was used to transform inputs into emissions?","eo:hasEmissionProducer, eo:EmissionGenerationActivity, prov:Entity","Emission producer links the generationActivity with the sources of material, animal, etc., we are interested in."
11,"What conversion factors can I use to report emissions for my activity for this specific location and time period (ie.., so the conversion factors exist)?","eo:validFrom, eo:validTo, eo:applicableLocation, eo:scope, qudt:quantityKind, qud:unit, eo:emissionSource",emissionSource links eo:EmissionGenerationActivity with emissionCalculationEntity
13,What is the geolocation associated with activities that this emission calculation includes?,"prov:location, eo:EmissionGenerationActivity",
