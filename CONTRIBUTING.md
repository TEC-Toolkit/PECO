# How to contribute

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to the PECO ontology!

To get an overview of the project, please read the [README](README.md).

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem or want to suggest a new term or use case, [search if it already exists in our issue tracker](https://github.com/TEC-Toolkit/PECO/issues).
If a related issue does not exist, you can open a new issue here on GitHub.

### Proposing new changes to the ontology
1. Edit the ontology using your favorite program. The latest version of the ontology can be found in the `development` folder.
2. Don't forget to add the motivation of your change, as well as metadata for the terms you would like to include

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
   - Using GitHub Desktop:
     - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
     - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)!
   - Using the command line:
     - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

Always write a clear log message for your commits.
One-line messages are fine for small changes.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Link your PR to the issue it addresses.
- Push your PR to the `dev` branch. One of the members of the team will merge it in the main branch.
